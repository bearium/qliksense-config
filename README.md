# Qlik Sense Enterprise on Kubernetes

## Installation of kustomize and build plugins

<<<<<<< HEAD
THe version of kustomize being using is v3.x , can be installed with Homebrew:
=======
The version of kustomize being using is v3.1.0, use the make command
>>>>>>> update readme

`make install`

<<<<<<< HEAD
You will also need (the go version of) yq installed, available from here (https://mikefarah.github.io/yq/])
 
 `brew install yq`
=======
to install both kustomize and build the required plugins to run kustomize. As well the built plugins will be moved to your `$HOME/.config/kustomize` folder or to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` if set.
>>>>>>> update readme

Finally, you will need helm,

 `brew install kubernetes-helm`
 
 
Create a convienience function that points to the root of this cloned repo:

```
function kustomizeIt {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  XDG_CONFIG_HOME="<Parent directory of this locally cloned repo>"
  kustomize build --enable_alpha_plugins $1
=======
  kustomize build --enable_alpha_plugins \
    "<Root of this repo>"/$1
>>>>>>> update readme
}
```

Then you can run:

`kustomizeIt .`

at almost level in this repo with a kustomization.yaml file and get some kind of YAML resources output but if you looking for a complete "all-in-one" `qlikense for Docker Desktop` configuration, navigate to the parent directory of this locally cloned repo and execute (may take 1/2 a minute or s0):

`kustomizeIt configs/qseok_devmode | kubectl apply -f -`

If you only wish to update one component, you can subsequently execute (ex. chronos):

`kustomizeIt configs/qseok_devmode/chronos | kubectl apply --prune -l app=chronos -f -`

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you wish to change a component configuration (ex "QCS-style", chronos includes own redis) you can execute:
=======
The `values.yaml` file is now multiple resource declarations (`kind: HelmValues`) that are used to "transform" the resource that generates the helm charts (`kind: HelmChart`).
These resources are declared in the individual component github repositories that are pulled in as resources transformed by adding the `values` in (`kind: HelmValues`), then excuted as generators which expand the helm charts.
The pipeline in kustomize is file system tree order. So the parent kustomization.yaml file operates on resources generated by kustomization.yaml files in child directories.  The `values.yaml` is now found in `generators/qliksense/transformers/defaultvalues.yaml`
>>>>>>> update readme

`kustomizeIt configs/qseok_ent_devmode/chronos | kubectl apply --prune -l app=chronos -f -`
